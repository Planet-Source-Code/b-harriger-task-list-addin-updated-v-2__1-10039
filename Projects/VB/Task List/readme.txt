VB Task List Add-In
By: Mark Joyal

I created this VB add-in to help me out when coding projects.  I wanted 
something to allow me to add a todo list right inside the VB IDE.  This 
addin shows a listview of tasks with checkboxes for each.  The window 
will dock to the IDE, and you can add new tasks by right clicking on the
listview and choosing "new task" or by doubleclicking in an empty slot.
You can edit tasks directly in the listview via the 2 click method.
Completed items are shown in gray(disabled) text.  A different task list
is kept for each project.  note: multiple projects open in the same 
instance of VB is not supported...yet...There is alot of good stuff here,
I hope you like it.

If you wish to use just the add-in and not bother with the code, just 
copy the .dll file to your windows/system32 directory and run regsvr32 
on it.
